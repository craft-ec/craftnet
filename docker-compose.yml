# CraftNet Multi-Node Test Environment
# Usage: docker compose up --build
#
# Discovery mechanisms:
# - mDNS: Nodes automatically discover each other on the same network
# - Rendezvous: Nodes can register with rendezvous servers for cross-network discovery

services:
  # Rendezvous server - central discovery point
  # Other nodes can use this as a rendezvous point
